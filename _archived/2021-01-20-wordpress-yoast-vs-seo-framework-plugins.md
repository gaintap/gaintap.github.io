Yoast has dominated the WordPress SEO plugin market for a long time. But as more people continue to use WordPress to develop their websites, more plugins surface, each of which has its own unique features. One of the more talked about SEO plugin alternatives to Yoast is SEO Framework. The plugin was created by a [WPMU Dev member](https://premium.wpmudev.org/forums/topic/new-unofficial-plugin-auto-description) while working on a WordPress website using a theme with limited SEO capabilities. It's since grown in popularity and it's commonly cited alongside Yoast as one of the best SEO plugins on WordPress. If you're unsure which SEO plugin you should use on your site, or if you're currently using an SEO plugin other than Yoast or SEO Framework and are looking to switch to something else, there are a lot of factors to consider. To help you make your decision, we've put together a head-to-head comparison of the two plugins.

## Yoast and SEO Framework Are Designed for Two Different Audiences

Yoast is a great starting point for people who do not know a lot about SEO; it's backed by a large support network and - due to its popularity - has a ton of [online training resources.](https://yoast.com/beginners-guide-yoast-seo/) SEO Framework, on the other hand, is more targeted at people with at least some SEO knowledge. And, since it's not backed by an entire development team like Yoast is, there are not as many training resources for new users. That being said, both have advantages and disadvantages, which you can see in the chart below:

## Both Plugins Provide Similar Data, But Yoast Also Provides Recommendations

[caption id="attachment_4950" align="alignnone" width="825"]![](https://www.gaintap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SEO-Framework-compared-with-Yoast-rating-interface.jpg) The SEO Framework plugin includes six metrics in its rating interface, whereas the Yoast plugin contains only two metrics: readability and SEO.[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4952" align="alignnone" width="958"]![](https://www.gaintap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SEO-Framework-title-and-meta-description-interface.png) The SEO Framework interface for titles and meta descriptions is very simple, but it has everything you need to optimize your pages.[/caption] Both interfaces have a system for rating each page's optimization, and provide basic tools, such as title length and meta description link, to guide you through the optimization process. Yoast also allows you to put in a "focus keyword," and it calculates several metrics, such as keyword density, based on that keyword. Although SEO Framework does not currently include an equivalent feature, the developer recently [announced plans to add one.](https://theseoframework.com/about/focus-keywords/) [caption id="attachment_4953" align="alignnone" width="954"]![](https://www.gaintap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Yoast-title-and-meta-description-interface.png) In addition to "title" and "meta description" boxes, Yoast includes a "focus keyword" box that you can use to gauge how effectively you're targeting your primary keyword.[/caption] In addition to those tools, Yoast provides suggestions for improving your SEO, such as adding the focus keyword to the title or adding images to the page. It also provides suggestions for improving your content, such as decreasing the length of paragraphs and sentences and adding more transition words. Those suggestions fall under Yoast's "readability" rating metric. [caption id="attachment_4956" align="alignnone" width="1037"]![](https://www.gaintap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Yoast-example-content-suggestions.png) The Yoast "readability" suggestions are broken down into three categories: "problems," "improvements" and "good results."[/caption] While some of these suggestions are helpful, some can be distracting - especially to users who are more writing focused. Yoast often makes it look like your writing is hurting your SEO when it's actually not.

## You Can Easily Test Out Both Plugins

If you're on the fence about which plugin to use, you can easily try out both. Download and install the [Yoast plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and the [SEO Framework plugin,](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/) and activate them one at a time to see how they work. And if you're more experienced with SEO, make sure you also play around with the settings on each one, as there are several advanced, technical features that can be customized.
