I've tried great scraping tools like [Import.io](https://www.import.io/) with no luck. This is especially the case if you're trying to pull search results from pages that Google hides as duplicates.

In this video, I show you how to use a free Chrome extension called [Linkclump](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj?hl=en) to quickly copy Google search results to a Google sheet.

## Most crawlers don't pull Google results. Here's why:

Scraping Google is against their terms of service; they go so far as to [block your IP](http://google-scraper.squabbel.com/) if you automate scraping of their search results.

1.  [Download Linkclump for Chrome.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj?hl=en)
2.  Adjust your Linkclump settings â€” set them to "Copy to Clipboard" on action.
3.  Open a spreadsheet.
4.  Search for a term.
5.  Right-click and drag to copy all links in the selection.
6.  Copy and paste the links into a spreadsheet.
7.  Go to the next page of search results.
8.  Rinse and repeat.

That's it! It's Super easy and fast, and it makes for an excellent project to outsource to a virtual assistant for chump change.
