### What are Conversion Optimization Services?

Conversion optimization services involve running tests on a website to improve desired positive results such as phone calls, contact form submissions and user registrations.

#### How we perform conversion optimization

We use software to perform a series of temporary, reversible experiments by editing the website's content to see what changes improve the positive actions and by how much they improve.

#### What to expect, step-by-step

We'll work with you to identify areas of improvement, put together a solid strategy to test changes and then execute the tests.

This includes:

- Understanding your business, website and what's lacking
- Putting together a series of test objectives such as improving conversion rate of a contact form
- Gaining access to the website's backend
- Installing scripts to run testing and analysis apps like Google Optimize, Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics
- Creating A / B tests to run experiments
- Monitoring experiments over a period of time often 2 weeks to 1 month
- Reporting on results of the experiment and whether to implement the changes 'permanently' on the site

#### Where it's performed 

Work is performed remotely.

#### How long conversion experiments last

Expect individual tests to take at least two weeks before clear results are determined. Some tests can be performed at the same time which shortens overall duration.

#### When work starts

Once we agree on terms of work, receive initial payment and have logins to your website.

#### Deliverable

Hours of industry leading advice that follows a written agenda/process, very carefully and concisely stated recommendations for your note taking, and later expansions as necessary. These are spread across 2-3 calls and multiple emails.

#### What's required of you

A principal or someone with access gathers materials for roughly one hour. Principals and critical leaders participate in the phone calls and homework, as appropriate, but mainly we just need decision makers in the loop.

#### Cost

$4,000 fee.

#### Payment Terms

Prepaid and non-refundable, sent with the materials that we’ll request.
