### What are Redesign Services?

This advisory service is based on the definitive book on this subject, *Financial Management of a Marketing Firm*, updated every year for a changing marketplace. The data is based on an intimate look at 900+ firms, supplemented by thousands of firms who have attended the seminar on the same topic.

### What we do (general)

Based on the financial materials that you supply, we’ll build a dynamically-updated five-page spreadsheet that captures all the significant metrics of your firm. It’s built so that you or your CFO/Controller can update it (typically quarterly) so keep an eye on how your firm is progressing.

### What we do (specific)

I’ll score your firm’s performance (based on the sub-type of firm that it is) and then suggest the appropriate range for each metric. We’ll discuss together how to impact that metric (what levers to pull) and how long it takes for the results to appear. In each case you’re comparing your own progress over time as well as how you compare with other firms of the same category and a similar size.

The analysis addresses these elements of performance:

1. Monthly Overhead.
2. Cash Cushion appropriate for your client base.
3. Ratio of Obligations to Assets.
4. Client Concentration and client distribution: minimum size, maximum size, and optimum size.
5. Number of Qualified Clients on your roster.
6. Ideal Yearly Client Spend.
7. Ideal Facility Size for your employee load, including minimum and maximum optimized space.
8. Ideal Facility Expense (Burdened) for your employee load, including minimum and maximum allowance.
9. Net Profit: actual and expected.
10. Target Principal Comp for you.
11. Unburdened Compensation Allowance for all other employees.
12. Accounts Receivable Outstanding measured in turnover days.
13. Utilization/Realization, measuring your financial opportunity vs. your financial output.
14. Fee Billings Per FTE, with an expected range for your specific type/size of firm.

### The fine details

#### Location. 

Remotely.

#### Duration.

From commencement to completion, expect this to span 1 month.

#### When work starts

Can usually be initiated within 1-2 weeks, depending on the time of year.

#### Deliverable

Hours of industry leading advice that follows a written agenda/process, very carefully and concisely stated recommendations for your note taking, and later expansions as necessary. These are spread across 2-3 calls and multiple emails.

#### What's required of you

A principal or someone with access gathers materials for roughly one hour. Principals and critical leaders participate in the phone calls and homework, as appropriate, but mainly we just need decision makers in the loop.

#### Cost

$4,000 fee.

#### Payment Terms

Prepaid and non-refundable, sent with the materials that we’ll request.
