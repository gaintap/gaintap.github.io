## Our redesign services are freaking amazing

![](/images/services/demo.jpg)


### You have options to get back on track.

If you’re experiencing a drop in visits, leads and sales as a result of your redesign then you need to know there are options to recover.

If you want a real world look at what it takes, see our case study on recovering from a failed redesign.

Every situation is a unique combination of problems so the fastest way to get your problems resolved will be having a conversation with us.

### Our process
- Determine a marketing baseline to compare the new website against
- Understand the goal of the redesign
- Audit the new website to identify reasons it is underperforming
- Provide a clear report explaining the issues, how to correct them, how much it will cost to fix them and how long it will take to see improvement
- Perform the work needed to restore the website’s performance

We primarily focus on issues that affect a website’s search engine marketing and ability to generate leads (conversion rate). This includes organic search engine rankings (SEO) and paid search advertising (Google Ads) as well as factors that reduce the website’s conversions (calls, contact forms, downloads, etc.)

### Expect the following when it comes to fixing your site:
- If you have a backup copy of your website, consider reverting to that. If it’s been weeks since launch, this may not be as effective.
- It’s going to take awhile to get back to where you were. Think weeks or months, not days.
- There are often multiple problems working together to reduce the effectiveness of your website.
- Being transparent and open with your company is the only way to get this resolved. This means access to people, analytics and performance data so we can make real changes that improve your company’s success.
- It is more time consuming and costly to recover from a bad redesign than to prevent it from happening in the first place.
